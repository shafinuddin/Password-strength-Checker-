🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python Mini Project)
📌 Project Description

This is a Python mini project that checks the strength of a password using string operations and conditional statements.
The program analyzes the password based on length and character types such as:

Uppercase letters

Lowercase letters

Digits

Special characters

Based on these conditions, the password is classified as Weak, Medium, or Strong.

🎯 Objective

To understand the use of strings in Python

To apply if–elif–else conditions

To learn loops and string methods

To build a real-life logic-based Python program

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Concepts Used:

Strings

Loops (for)

Conditional statements

Boolean variables

Built-in string functions

▶️ How the Program Works

The user enters a password.

The program checks each character in the password.

It identifies:

Uppercase letters

Lowercase letters

Numbers

Special characters

Based on predefined conditions, the password strength is displayed.

🧪 Password Rules

Strong Password

Minimum 8 characters

Contains uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character

Medium Password

Minimum 6 characters

Contains letters and digits

Weak Password

Less than 6 characters or missing required conditions

💻 Sample Output
Enter your password: Hello@123
Password Strength: STRONG

Enter your password: abc123
Password Strength: MEDIUM

Enter your password: abc
Password Strength: WEAK
